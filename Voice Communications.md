To speak to another person either locally or far away using your audible voice.

## TL;DR - what should I use? What should I get?
The best voice communication tool is a cell phone or home phone if the grid is up.
The next best is a handheld or mobile radio. I recommend GMRS radios
- a good GMRS radio 
- a GMRS license for your family ($35)
