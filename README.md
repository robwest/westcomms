# Family Communications Plan
A document about learning about and communicating with technology as a hobby and for times when normal communications methods are not available.

**These documents are a work in progress and will be updated over time**

## Document Structure
I have chosen to use a plaintext format for writing because this will always be readable. I will periodically publish these as PDF files as well for easier reading offline.

I will try to keep **summary** information in this file, and **detailed** information will be linked to other documents.

## Table of Contents
1. What is the purpose of a comms plan?
2. What does this plan cover?
3. I don't want to read - just tell me what to get
4. Voice Communication
5. Text Messaging
6. Internet
